# About

City Pass offers two mobile applications and one web-based portal, developed using React Native, React, and Firebase technologies. The first application, City-Pass-Buyer, enables users to take advantage of various offers in their selected geographic area, with the added convenience of pre-booking. The second application, City-Pass-Seller, allows users to create a seller account and post offers for potential buyers to view on a map. The web portal is designed for the administrator to monitor all sales and purchases made through the mobile applications. It features a streamlined dashboard that provides insights into the margins obtained.
